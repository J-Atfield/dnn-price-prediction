# Deep Neural Networks for Stock Price Prediction

A short project detailing the theory behind LSTM DNNs and thier usage for prediciton of time series data, namely the closing price of a set of given stocks. To assess the efficacy of such methods a comparison is made to the well established method of using geometric brownian motion to model asset prices.

### Project Structure

The folder [NN Notebook](\NN%Notebook) contains the notebook with all LSTM code, from setup to testing, within it as well as five pre-trained models should one wish to run it quickly. The folder [GBM Notebook](\GBM%Notebook) contains the relevant code to execute the GBM model for the same stocks as those five NN models. The pdf titled [Report](\Report.pdf) contains all relevant background theory as well as the results from both models, with discussion relating to the applicability in the real world.
